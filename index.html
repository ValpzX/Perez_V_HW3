                Ghostface is the main antagonist of the Scream film series. In each film, the Ghostface killer often calls their victims on the phone, taunting or threatening them before stabbing them to death with a hunting knife. The killer occasionally asks his victims horror movie trivia, and stalks them in a manner reminiscent of said films.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                The identity of Ghostface is always unknown until the final act, in which they proceed to reveal themselves and their motive. In each film except for the 3rd, there have been two Ghostface killers working as accomplices; the 6th installment is rumoured to have 3 killers. No Ghostface killers have ever survived, they are ultimately always defeated at the end of each film.

            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Sidney Prescott is the original protagonist of the Scream franchise. Throughout the series' single continuity, Sidney's survivability and strength are tested against a variety of Ghostface perpetrators and their accomplices. She evolves from victim to local celebrity survivor after defeating the original Woodsboro killers and matures from a teenage girl with unresolved trauma to a hardened adult woman and mother.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                In the original four films directed by Wes Craven, she is Ghostface's primary target. In the fifth installment reboot, she takes on a vengeance-seeking vigilante role against Ghostface; no longer being the primary target, she reluctantly returns to Woodsboro on the near-25th anniversary of the original massacre to avenge the murder of a beloved legacy character against psychotic fanatics of the original Stab film desiring a real-life reboot.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Dwight Riley, predominantly known as Dewey, is the Woodsboro Sheriff and serves as a protective figure to Sidney Prescott amid the Ghostface killings. Along the way, he sustains multiple lifelong injuries and nine stab wounds, but works on physical therapy between entries. Throughout the film series, he has an on-off again love affair with an older news reporter and author, Gale Weathers, who he eventually marries.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Dewey was originally supposed to die early on in the film series after being stabbed in the back by Ghostface but Wes Craven liked the character so much that he decided to film a shot of Dewey being carried into an ambulance in case audiences also liked the character. Sure enough, Dewey was a hit amongst the audiences so Wes Craven decided to use the ending where Dewey lives.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Gale Weathers is a main character in the Scream film franchise. Alongside Sidney Prescott, she has solved and survived the events of all Ghostface killing sprees. She is a former reporter and the ex-wife of former Sheriff Dewey Riley whom she meets in the first film. Throughout the films, she eventually develops a trust and bond with Sidney Prescott. 
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                After the events of the first film, Gale writes a book based on Sidney Prescott's life and the real-life events that occured. After publishing it, a movie adaptation of the book is released a couple of years later and marks the beginning of "Stab" franchise. Despite promising not to write more about the Ghostface killings, Gale continues to do so after the events of each film.

                Samantha Carpenter, predominantly known as Sam, is the new protagonist of the Scream film franchise as of the fifth Scream installment. Having run from a troubled past, the former Woodsboro resident returns to her haunted small California hometown to aid her younger sister, Tara, against a new Ghostface entity.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Sam is confronted with both her troubled teen past and birth origin and becomes the new main target of Ghostface. After hearing about the attack of her younger sister, Tara, she is forced to return to Woodsboro and joins forces with original legacy franchise survivors, Dewey Riley, Gale Weathers, and Sidney Prescott, to stop the new Ghostface killers.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Tara Carpenter is a new recurring character of the Scream film franchise that is introduced in the fifth Scream installment. While home alone, the "elevated horror" fan becomes the first target of the 2021 killings. Despite this, she survives, an inverse to the tradition of the previous four film openings.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Her survival is intentional, however. She is lured as live bait for her estranged, older sister Sam Carpenter. The estranged sisters put the past behind them to survive the 25th anniversary killings, where Tara's Woodsboro High friendship group are suspects.
